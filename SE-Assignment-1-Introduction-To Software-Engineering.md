# **Software Engineering**

### What is Software Engineering?
<br> **Software engineering** is a discipline that applies engineering principles to the development of software systems.
- Its a systematic approach that to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.
- It involves applying engineering principles to ensure that software systems are reliable, maintainable, scalable, and meet the intended requirements.

> Difference between Software Engineering and Traditional Programming

Software engineering emphasizes:
- **Planning**: Defining clear requirements and designing an optimal solution.
- **Teamwork**: Collaboration among designers, developers, testers, and stakeholders,
   or multiple engineers with specialized skills.
- **Quality assurance**: Rigorous testing and verification to ensure compliance.
- **Maintainability**: Designing software systems that can be easily updated and extended,
   ensuring traceability and maintaining comprehensive documentation throughout the development cycle.

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The SDLC is a structured process that defines the steps involved in developing software. 
<br> It typically consists of the following phases:
-	**Requirements Gathering**: Identifying and defining the user needs and requirements.
-	**Analysis**: Breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable components.
-	**Design**: Creating a blueprint for the software system, including its architecture, components, and interfaces.
-	**Implementation (Coding)**: Writing the actual software code based on the design.
-	**Testing**: Verifying and validating the software's functionality, performance and reliability.
-	**Deployment**: Installing and releasing the software into production.
-	**Maintenance**: Updating, fixing bugs, and enhancing the software over its lifetime. 	<br>
