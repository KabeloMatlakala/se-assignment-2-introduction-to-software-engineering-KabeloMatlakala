# **Software Engineering**

### What is Software Engineering?
<br> **Software engineering** is a discipline that applies engineering principles to the development of software systems.
- Its a systematic approach that to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.
- It involves applying engineering principles to ensure that software systems are reliable, maintainable, scalable, and meet the intended requirements.

> Difference between Software Engineering and Traditional Programming

Software engineering emphasizes:
- **Planning**: Defining clear requirements and designing an optimal solution.
- **Teamwork**: Collaboration among designers, developers, testers, and stakeholders,
   or multiple engineers with specialized skills.
- **Quality assurance**: Rigorous testing and verification to ensure compliance.
- **Maintainability**: Designing software systems that can be easily updated and extended,
   ensuring traceability and maintaining comprehensive documentation throughout the development cycle.

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The SDLC is a structured process that defines the steps involved in developing software. 
<br> It typically consists of the following phases:
-	**Requirements Gathering**: Identifying and defining the user needs and requirements.
-	**Analysis**: Breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable components.
-	**Design**: Creating a blueprint for the software system, including its architecture, components, and interfaces.
-	**Implementation (Coding)**: Writing the actual software code based on the design.
-	**Testing**: Verifying and validating the software's functionality, performance and reliability.
-	**Deployment**: Installing and releasing the software into production.
-	**Maintenance**: Updating, fixing bugs, and enhancing the software over its lifetime. 	<br> 

#### Agile vs. Waterfall Models
**Agile**: An iterative and incremental approach where teams work in short cycles, constantly adapting to changing requirements.
Agile is preferred when:
⦁	Requirements are constantly evolving.
⦁	User feedback is critical.
⦁	Time-to-market is a priority.

⦁	Iterative and incremental, focusing on flexibility and rapid delivery.
⦁	Requirements and design evolve throughout the development process.
⦁	Close collaboration between developers, testers, and customers.
⦁	Suitable for complex and rapidly changing projects.


**Waterfall**: A sequential approach where each phase is completed before the next one begins.
Waterfall is preferred when:
⦁	Requirements are well-defined and stable.
⦁	A structured process is desired.

⦁	Linear and sequential, with clear phases that are completed one after another.
⦁	Requirements are fixed early in the process and rarely change.
⦁	Minimum customer involvement during development.
⦁	Suitable for stable projects with well-defined requirements.
                                                                                                                                          ***
### Requirements Engineering
**Requirements engineering** is the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders in a software system. It includes activities such as:

Stakeholder analysis, Requirements elicitation, Requirements specification
Requirements validation

Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, and managing user requirements. It ensures that the software system aligns with its intended objectives and meets the needs of stakeholders.
